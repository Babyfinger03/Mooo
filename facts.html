            <h2>Cows: Our Genetic Cousins</h2>
            <p>Cows and humans share more than just a passing resemblance in some of our genes; about 80% of cow genes are identical to those found in humans. This genetic kinship was revealed when scientists decoded the bovine genome in 2009.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Wealth in Livestock</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, cattle have been a symbol of wealth and prosperity. The term "cattle" itself stems from the Old French word "chatel," meaning property. In various cultures, owning cattle has long been associated with economic affluence.</p>

            <p>Cows, known scientifically as bovines, have surprising habits. Contrary to popular belief, they don't spend their days just grazing and sleeping. They enjoy moments of playfulness, whether it's chasing balls or interacting socially with other animals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Debunking the Myth of Cow Tipping</h2>
            <p>Despite urban legends suggesting otherwise, cow tipping isn't as easy as it sounds. In fact, it's nearly impossible for humans to tip over a cow due to the immense force required. Researchers have debunked this myth, emphasizing the sheer strength needed to topple these sturdy animals.</p>

        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Cows play a significant role in greenhouse gas emissions due to their methane production during digestion. With billions of cattle worldwide, reducing meat and dairy consumption is increasingly recognized as an effective means of combating climate change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>The Social Side of Cows</h2>

        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Natural Navigators</h2>
            <p>Studies have shown that cows possess an innate ability to align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field while grazing or resting. This peculiar behavior remains a mystery to researchers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>360-Degree Awareness</h2>
            <p>Cattle have impressive panoramic vision, with only minimal blind spots. This keen eyesight helps them stay vigilant against potential threats in their surroundings.</p>

            <h2>Colorblind Creatures</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Diverse Dialects</h2>
            <p>Just like human languages, cows exhibit dialectical variations in their moos, influenced by their immediate peer groups. This intriguing aspect highlights the complexity of their communication.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Digestive Marvels</h2>
            <p>While often simplified as having four stomachs, cows actually have one large stomach with four compartments. This complex digestive system enables them to efficiently process the large quantities of grass they consume daily.</p>
